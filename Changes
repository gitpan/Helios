Revision history for Perl extension Helios.

2.23  Fri Sep 10 12:22:00 2010
	-Helios::Job: fixed bug where getArgXML() returned undef if job
	 object was vivified from job queue
2.22  Thu May 21 11:30:00 2009
	-Helios::Service: fixed a bug in getFuncidFromDb() that caused 
	 services to fail to load properly if there was no entry for them 
	 in FUNCMAP table.
	-helios.pl: Several revisions to make it a more robust daemon. Now
	 honors TERM signal; 'kill <pid>' from a shell will attempt to 
	 safely shut down workers and daemon process w/o using Panoptes
	-Documentation updates
2.21  Thu May 14 17:00:00 2009
	-added set/getJob() accessors to facilitate access to current 
	 Helios::Job object from methods other than run()
2.20  Tue Apr 28 18:00:00 2009
    -various tweaks for cross-platform compatibility
    -documentation additions/corrections
    -added Helios::LogEntry::Levels to remove dependencies on 
     Sys::Syslog
    -helios.pl: Cleaned up messages to console after daemonize
	-helios.pl + Helios::Service: added support for WORKER_MAX_TTL 
	 config param
    -Helios::Service: added JobClass() allow extensible Helios::Job 
     classes
    -Helios::Service: added MaxRetries() and RetryInterval() to replace
     TheSchwartz's max_retries() and retry_interval() (this is not an 
     abitrary change; it's to allow for extensions at the Helios layer 
     in the future)
    -Helios::Service: added default run() method for class completeness
     (it throws a Helios::Error::FatalNoRetry error because you forgot 
     to implement a run() method)
    -Helios::Service: removed logging to syslogd to eliminate 
     Sys::Syslog dependency (see HeliosX::ExtLoggerService)
    -Helios::Service: added set/getFuncid(), getFuncidFromDb() and 
     changed jobWaiting() to use them.  This eliminates an unnecessary 
     database query previously done every time jobsWaiting() was called
    -Helios::Service: added support for log_priority_threshold config 
     param
    -Helios::Job: added getFailures() to access the number of times a 
     job has previously failed
