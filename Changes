Revision history for Perl extension Helios.

2.30_5071  Sun Dec 18 02:30:00 2011
	-Added Helios::Error::BaseError and modified all Helios::Error::
	 exception classes to subclass it instead of Error::Simple 
	 directly.  This creates an actual exception class hierarchy, 
	 and makes it easy to determine whether a caught exception is a 
	 Helios error or another kind of error.  (It might also allow 
	 an eventual move from Error to another exception handling 
	 system.)
2.30_5041  Thu Dec 15 23:40:00 2011
	-Completely rewrote submitJob.pl to allow requester to send job 
	 arg XML in an HTTP POST; the form encoding is no longer 
	 necessary (though is still supported to ensure compatibility)
	 See submitJob.pl for updated job XML syntax
	 New submitJob.pl also eliminates dependency on HELIOS_CLASS_MAP 
	 to determine the proper class for a particular job type (though 
	 HELIOS_CLASS_MAP is still supported)
	-Removed vestigial dependency on XML::Parser in Helios::Job &
	 removed mention of it in Makefile.PL
	-Corrected Makefile.PL to remove mention of XML::SAX, 
	 XML::Namespace as dependencies (Helios's only direct XML::*
	 dependency is XML::Simple)
	-Corrected Makefile.PL with older versions of DBI and XML::Simple.
	 These versions were packaged as RPMs with CentOS 5.7.  This 
	 change helps installation on RPM-based Linux OSes, and Helios is 
	 compatible with these versions.
2.30_4931  Wed Dec 07 00:52:00 2011
	-Switch to "Linux-style" versioning: 
	 odd minor version == development version
	 even minor version == stable version
	 second minor number == patch level
	 (we're still also using Perl-style _ for devel versions too)
	-Merged in HeliosX::ExtLoggerService functionality 
	 (long overdue but not tested yet!)
	-Removed Helios::Service->parseArgXML() (deprecated since 2.00)
	-Removed Helios::Worker (deprecated since 2.00)
2.23  Fri Sep 10 12:22:00 2010
	-Helios::Job: fixed bug where getArgXML() returned undef if job
	 object was vivified from job queue
2.22  Thu May 21 11:30:00 2009
	-Helios::Service: fixed a bug in getFuncidFromDb() that caused 
	 services to fail to load properly if there was no entry for them 
	 in FUNCMAP table.
	-helios.pl: Several revisions to make it a more robust daemon. Now
	 honors TERM signal; 'kill <pid>' from a shell will attempt to 
	 safely shut down workers and daemon process w/o using Panoptes
	-Documentation updates
2.21  Thu May 14 17:00:00 2009
	-added set/getJob() accessors to facilitate access to current 
	 Helios::Job object from methods other than run()
2.20  Tue Apr 28 18:00:00 2009
    -various tweaks for cross-platform compatibility
    -documentation additions/corrections
    -added Helios::LogEntry::Levels to remove dependencies on 
     Sys::Syslog
    -helios.pl: Cleaned up messages to console after daemonize
	-helios.pl + Helios::Service: added support for WORKER_MAX_TTL 
	 config param
    -Helios::Service: added JobClass() allow extensible Helios::Job 
     classes
    -Helios::Service: added MaxRetries() and RetryInterval() to replace
     TheSchwartz's max_retries() and retry_interval() (this is not an 
     abitrary change; it's to allow for extensions at the Helios layer 
     in the future)
    -Helios::Service: added default run() method for class completeness
     (it throws a Helios::Error::FatalNoRetry error because you forgot 
     to implement a run() method)
    -Helios::Service: removed logging to syslogd to eliminate 
     Sys::Syslog dependency (see HeliosX::ExtLoggerService)
    -Helios::Service: added set/getFuncid(), getFuncidFromDb() and 
     changed jobWaiting() to use them.  This eliminates an unnecessary 
     database query previously done every time jobsWaiting() was called
    -Helios::Service: added support for log_priority_threshold config 
     param
    -Helios::Job: added getFailures() to access the number of times a 
     job has previously failed
